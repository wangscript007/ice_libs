# ice_libs

Collection of cross-platform single-header C libraries for doing a lot of stuff! (Still WIP)

### Brief

ice_libs is collection of Single-Header C libraries, Designed to introduce stuff that sokol and some single-header libs didn't offered, In addition to more stuff offered by these libs.

### Goals

1. Portability: Supports ANSI C and onwards!
2. Cross-Platform: Runs on a lot of platform, Including Game Consoles.
3. Customizable: You can build shared libs of any ice library by the way you want.
4. Platform-Detectable: ice libraries can detect platform that program runs on, So you are not forced to define implementation platform and backend used.
5. Controllable: Offers custom memory allocators, Custom calling conventions, And more...
6. Bindings-Friendly: Designed to make bindings much easier!
7. Easy to code.
8. Optimizable.
9. Easy to license: ice libraries allows you to choose between 2 licenses: Public Domain and MIT!
